# Cute Dog Collector (single-page app)

## How it works

Press the button on the top left to generate a new random dog (photo).
Each dog (photo) can be rated as cute or not cute, which will trigger some UI changes (such as random border colours).
Each dog (photo) can only be rated once -- **and you cannot undo** without refreshing the page (and getting new random pictures).
A simple counter on the top left keeps track of the number of dogs viewed and that marked as 'cute'.

## Development Notes

A simple single-page application making API calls using `async` / `await`, `try...catch`.
