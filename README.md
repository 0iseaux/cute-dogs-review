# Cute Dogs Reviewer SPA (Single-page Application)

[Try the App](https://0iseaux.github.io/cute-dogs-review/)

## How it works

Press the button on the top left to generate a new random dog (photo).
Each dog (photo) can be rated as cute or not cute, which will trigger some UI changes (such as random border colours).
Each dog (photo) can only be rated once -- **and you cannot undo** without refreshing the page.
A simple counter on the top left keeps track of the number of dogs viewed and that marked as 'cute'.

The current version has no backend and does not support photo-saving, but it may come as a feature in future.

## Development Notes

A simple single-page application making API calls using `async` / `await`, `try...catch`.
